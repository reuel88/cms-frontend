        <strong>Calculator Disclosure</strong>
      </h3>

      <p>
        The projected values shown are hypothetical in nature and should not be
        relied on. They may be affected by inaccurate assumptions or risks and
        uncertainties and will differ materially from results ultimately
        achieved. In order to calculate the expected return for each asset
        class, the investment team first researched the historical total returns
        of the index or similar asset class underlying the ETFs (fee and
        currency adjusted).
      </p>

      <p>
        For the IVV, IEU, 30 years of historical data was used to calculate the
        return. For the STW 20 years of historical data was used for the IAA,
        IAF, RCB 10 years of historic information was used. An interest rate of
        2.5% and inflation rate of 2% were assumed. All returns are deflated for
        inflation. Factors that can cause significant variation from the
        historic risks are outlined in the product disclosure statement.
      </p>

      <p>
        The white centre line on the charts is the most likely outcome based on
        the data. The shaded envelope around the centre line is the risk
        envelopes to a 95% confidence interval, based on the historical data and
        illustrates the risks in a graphical format of achieving an expected
        portfolio value.
