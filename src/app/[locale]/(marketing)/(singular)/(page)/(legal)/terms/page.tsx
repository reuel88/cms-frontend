        the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Product Disclosure
        Statement with respect to your use of the Raiz services, and your Raiz
        Investment Account. Any services that you receive from Raiz will be

        App. By using the Website or App, you agree that the then current
        version of this Agreement (including any amendments effective at that
        time) applies to your use of the Website or App.

              Certain legislation including the Australian Consumer Law, may
              imply warranties or conditions or impose obligations, remedies or
              guarantees which cannot be excluded, restricted or modified except
              to a limited extent. Such legislation may, for example, impose
              non-excludable guarantees that goods are of acceptable quality or
              that services will be rendered with due care and skill (with
              certain remedies available to consumers for certain breaches of
              such guarantees). To the extent that such legislation applies,
              this Agreement must be read subject to those statutory provisions.
              If those statutory provisions apply, notwithstanding any other
              provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Raiz is entitled
              to do so, Raiz limits its liability pursuant to such provisions
              for any goods to the replacement, repair or refund of the cost of
              goods, or for services, to the re-supply or the payment of the
              cost of having the services supplied again.
            </li>
            <li>
              You agree to fully compensate Raiz and its officers, employees and
              agents from and against reasonable liability, loss, damage, costs
              and expense (including, without limitation, reasonable legal
              expenses on a reasonable basis) and penalties incurred or suffered
              by any of them arising out of:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  your material breach of this Agreement (noting that for the
                  purposes of this clause 6.f, a material breach will include,
                  without limitation, a breach of a representation, obligation
                  or warranty);
                </li>
                <li>
                  any misuse or use of Raiz Content in breach of this Agreement;

              The technology used by the Raiz Website and App involves machine
              learning (“ML”), which is a computational method that uses
              existing data to continually refine algorithm, improve performance
              and to make predictions. Certain types of inaccuracies are
              inherent and unavoidable in the use of this type of technology.
              You agree and accept that ML inaccuracies may arise in the course
              of Raiz providing services to you, which may adversely affect you,
              and that it may not always be possible for Raiz to identify such
              inaccuracies and/or provide you with notification of such
              instances. To the full extent permitted by law and subject to
              clause 6.e Raiz does not accept any responsibility for loss or
              costs of any kind you suffer as a result of or in connection with
              any inherent inaccuracies or omissions arising from the use of ML.
              However, Raiz will use its best endeavours to correct any such
              underlying inaccuracies where they are identified.

              If you have signed-up for, and maintain in good standing, an
              Active Raiz Investment Account, from time to time certain third
              party promotions may be available to you (Raiz Rewards
              Promotions).
            </li>
            <li>
              Details of all current Raiz Rewards Promotions that are open to
              eligible participants from time to time – being customers who have
              an Active Raiz Investment Account- will be set out at the Raiz
              Rewards page within the App including the relevant Participation
              Terms for each Raiz Rewards Promotion. An Active Raiz Investment
              Account is an account which has a positive balance and where you
              are paying a monthly account fee and/ or a monthly maintenance
              fee.
            </li>
            <li>
              By participating in a Raiz Rewards Promotion, you agree to comply
              with the Participation Terms for that Raiz Rewards Promotion
              (which will be incorporated into and form part of this Agreement).
              You should carefully read the Participation Terms for each Raiz
              Rewards Promotion along with the terms and conditions of this
              Agreement and the Raiz Privacy Policy before participating and, if
              you do not accept those terms, you should not participate in the
              Promotion.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each Raiz Rewards Promotion runs for a limited term only, as set
              out in the relevant Participation Terms (the Promotion Term).
            </li>
            <li>
              Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Raiz may
              terminate, cancel or amend all or any portion of any Raiz Rewards
              Promotion at any time by amending the details of the Raiz Rewards
              Promotion on the Raiz Rewards page within the App. Advance notice
              will be provided (via the Raiz Rewards page within the App) where
              possible. However, you acknowledge that the Raiz Rewards
              Promotions are offered by Third Party Retailers and therefore
              there may be circumstances where Raiz is unable to provide advance
              notice of such changes.
            </li>
            <li>
              During the Promotion Term of a Raiz Rewards Promotion, if you make
              an eligible purchase (Eligible Purchase) from a specified third
              party retailer (Third Party Retailer), the Third Party Retailer
              will contribute an amount of money (Customer Benefit) for
              investment into your Active Raiz Investment Account as set out in
              the Participation Terms for that Raiz Rewards Promotion, provided
              you meet all eligibility requirements as set out in the
              Participation Terms.
            </li>
            <li>
              During the Promotion Term of a Raiz Rewards Promotion the Third
              Party Retailer may pay an amount to Raiz Invest Limited for
              promoting the Raiz Reward Promotion, which may be a flat amount of
              money or an amount of money which is a percentage of an Eligible
              Purchase.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Participation Terms for a Raiz Rewards Promotion will set out
              details of what constitutes an Eligible Purchase for that Raiz
              Rewards Promotion. An Eligible Purchase may, for example, be a
              purchase of a particular product from the Third Party Retailer, a
              purchase made from the Third Party Retailer via a particular sales
              channel (e.g. from a particular website), a purchase over a
              particular value from the Third Party Retailer or some other kind
              of specified category of purchase. An Eligible Purchase may be
              limited to purchases that occur in certain fact scenarios only
              (for example, only in certain locations). You may therefore not be
              eligible for all Third Party Promotions. You should therefore
              carefully check the Participation Terms for the Third Party
              Promotion to determine whether you are eligible.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Participation Terms for a Raiz Rewards Promotion will specify
              the amount of the Customer Benefit, or the means by which that
              amount will be calculated, and any other relevant details
              regarding payment of Customer Benefits. The Customer Benefit is
              only for investment in your Active Raiz Investment Account and may
              not be received by you in cash or in any other form. Raiz will
              receive all such Customer Benefits paid by the Third Party
              Retailer on your behalf and, once a Customer Benefit is received
              from the Third Party Retailer, will process such payment into your
              Active Raiz Investment Account as soon as reasonably practicable.
              Please be aware that there will be a delay between when you make
              the Eligible Purchase, and when the Customer Benefit appears in
              your Active Raiz Investment Account.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Customer Benefit is paid by the Third Party Retailer, not by
              Raiz and Raiz has no control over the Third Party Retailer’s
              payment of this amount. To the full extent permitted by law, Raiz
              excludes all liability in connection with any delay or failure by
              the Third Party Retailer to pay you any Customer Benefit.
            </li>
            <li>
              The right to participate in a Raiz Rewards Promotion is not
              transferable to any other person.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any link to a Third Party Retailer’s website or associated third
              party website is a Linked Site for the purposes of this Agreement
              and subject to the provisions dealing with Linked Sites.
            </li>
            <li>
              Raiz is not a party to the contract formed between you and the
              Third Party Retailer for the Eligible Purchase, and to the full
              extent permitted by law hereby excludes all liability in
              connection with Eligible Purchases or any other transaction or
              engagement between you and the Third Party Retailer. In addition,
              to the full extent permitted by law, Raiz excludes all liability
              that arises if you are unable to participate in a Raiz Rewards
              Promotion due to an issue encountered with the Third Party
              Retailer (such as a fault or issue with the Third Party Retailer’s
              payment system, or a withdrawal of the Raiz Rewards Promotion by
              the Third Party Retailer).
            </li>
            <li>
              To the extent that you believe that a Third Party Retailer has
              failed to pay you a Customer Benefit that you are entitled to, you
              may notify Raiz on support@raizinvest.com.au or on 1300 754 748.
              Raiz will, upon timely receipt of any such notice, contact the
              Third Party Retailer regarding payment of the Customer Benefit,
              and undertake reasonable investigations. Raiz decision (or if
              appropriate, the Third Party Retailer’s) in respect of such matter
              will be final and binding.
            </li>
            <li>
              In order to be able to participate in a Raiz Rewards Promotion, it
              may be necessary in some instances to activate certain settings on
              your mobile device (e.g. to allow cookies). If you are unable to
              access a Raiz Rewards Promotion please contact us at

              tampering or other gaming is occurring in connection with the Raiz
              Rewards program, or may suspend your access to the Raiz Rewards
              program if Raiz forms the reasonable view that you are involved in

                  If the debit day is not a Business Day, we can debit your
                  account on the next Business Day. If you are uncertain about
                  when a debit payment has been or will be processed, you should

                  contact us using the contact details on the front of this PDS
                  as soon as possible. We can ask you to confirm your query in

                  writing of the action we have taken within 21 days.

                  your account accordingly (including in relation to interest
                  and charges). To the extent permitted by law, we will not be
                  liable for any other losses suffered by you. If we find that
